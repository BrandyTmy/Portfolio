My motivation for this project was to be able to secure employment after bootcamp. I am aware that I am extremley early on in coding so I hope to be able to update this portfolio with all of the new technique I am learning, inside and outside of the classes themselves.

This project was somthing that was created as a place for me to store and advertise all of my completed projects, to one day be able to market myself into a postion in web design. 

I have learned alot throughout this project, mainly that all of the information needed to complete my tasks is something that I have acess to, weather I am reaching out to the instructors, or googling, or readining the documentation online, I bascially have everything I need, it is just amatter of putting the information to use, and knowing what information to search for.
